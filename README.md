# IG
a small recreation of instagram.
I've tried to remake a small and compact version of instagram to the best of my abilities.
by multiplying the "reel-box" div in HTML codes you can get more posts.
also by putting img tags with "story" class in "div1" div you can have as many stories as you want.
there is a very small js code for liking the posts that you can enhance and also you can customize the css to get a more appealing website.
The website has been designed responsive to both desktops and mobile phones, you can report any irregularities that you might come across.
I will also try to update this code and enhance the features and try to upgrade the UI whenever I can.
